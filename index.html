            <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. It includes both theoretical and
                practical aspects of computing, including algorithms, programming languages, computer architecture, and
                more.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that focuses on the development of algorithms that can
                learn
                from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning has numerous applications in
                fields
                such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, and has led to the development of technologies such as
                speech
                recognition, image and video recognition, and self-driving cars.</p>
